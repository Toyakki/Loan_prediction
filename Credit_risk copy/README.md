# Simple credit risk analysis



## How each feature in the raw csv may contribute to the credit risk:

Age: Generally, it is assumed that the older the person, the more experienced in repaying loans. Older individuals might be considered lower risk due to longer credit histories and potentially more stable financial situations.

Sex: While gender should not be a factor in determining credit risk from an ethical and legal standpoint, some models historically have included it. Today, more emphasis is placed on non-discriminatory factors, so we are going to ignore this.

Job: Employment status and job stability are significant indicators of one's ability to repay loans. Individuals in stable, well-paying jobs are typically considered lower risk.

Housing:Owning a home can be seen as a sign of financial stability, potentially lowering credit risk. Conversely, renting or unstable housing situations might be viewed as higher risk.

Saving accounts/Checking account: The amount in saving/checking acounts can indicate financial prudence and stability, suggesting a lower credit risk.

Credit Amount: Higher loan amounts may be more difficult to be repaid, depending on the individual's financial situation, and therefore may indicate higher risk (bad).  

Duration: Longer loan durations mean more time required to repay, which may indicate higher risk (bad).

Purpose: car, radio/tv, furniture, business, education, repairs, domestic appliances, vacation/others. The purpose of the loan may indicate the individual's intentions, which could be a factor in determining credit risk. For example, a loan requested for a business and car may be considered higher risk than a loan for a home repairs or furniture.
